## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 with help from Emmet
- CSS 
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

vertical-align: middle; 
It took a long time to find out how to center text next
to text. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="prices">
  <p>
    <span class="current-price">$149.99</span>
    <span class="old-price">$169.99</span>
  </p>
</div>
```
```css
.current-price {
  font-family: 'Fraunces', sans-serif;
  color: var(--primary-dark-cyan);
  font-size: 2.3rem;
  margin-right: 2rem;
  vertical-align: middle;
}
```
